OBSourceFilesRequest is used to work around the fact that Squeak's source files are stored in a global array called SourceFiles. When testing OBMethodVersion and OBVersionBrowser, we don't want to use the real source files, as they are too unpredictable. Instead the test cases supply a source file array with known contents.

Therefore, OBMethodVersion never refers directly to the SourceFiles global. Instead it raises an OBSourceFiles request. If this occurs during a test, the test catches the notification and resumes using the test source files. Otherwise, the default action resumes using the global source file array.!
