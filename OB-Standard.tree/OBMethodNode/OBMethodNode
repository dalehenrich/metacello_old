OBMethodNode wraps a method in a particular class. It supplies an OBMethodDefinition for displaying and editing the source code of the method, and various actions for manipulating the method. It has two roles: first it appears in the right most pane of a standard system browser. Second, it often serves as the root node for an OBListBrowser, and has navigation methods for senders, implementors etc.

OBMethodNode also serves as the superclass for nodes that represent *parts* of a method, such as sends of a particular message, references to a class, accesses to a instance variable, etc.!
