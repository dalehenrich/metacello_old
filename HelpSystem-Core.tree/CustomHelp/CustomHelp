This is a common superclass for custom help. Subclasses of this class are automatically included into the system help.

By default the informations provided on the receiver class are converted into help topics by a specific builder 
- here the CustomHelpHelpBuilder. Note that you can provide an own custom builder by overriding the #builder method
