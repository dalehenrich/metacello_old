- Issue 119:  leading trailing spaces in spec names should be flagged as input errors
  http://code.google.com/p/metacello/issues/detail?id=119
- Since Issue 119 involves throwing a creation-time error, I needed to solve the general problem of what to do when errros occur during version creation. Errors that occur during project construction no longer cause a halt to the proceedings. Project construction proceeds, however, the version with the error is (obviously) not available for use. If on accesses such a version, a MetacelloVersionDefinitionError (a kindOf: MetacelloVersionDoesNotExistError) that is thrown. If you wrap project creation with the following exception handler:
  [ConfigurationOfExample project ] 
	on: MetacelloErrorInProjectConstructionNotification 
	do: [:ex | ex resume: true ].
  the Error is thrown immediately.
- There is also a new error reasonCode (#''versionCreationError'') to flag these errors for the validator.

- resurrecting spec tests from Metacello-Tests-dkh.225. The spec tests hadn''t been updated during the major refactoring that went on with the help of Doru to create the ConfigurationOfXXX as we know today, so they have been left behind (around Fall of 2009) ... now is as good a time as ever to resurrect the tests so we have tests for the basic functionality of the spec classes including MetacelloMemberspec and metacello memberListSpec ...
